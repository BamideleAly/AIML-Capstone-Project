# AIML-Capstone-Project with Imperial College
Name of the Project Exchange Rate Stability: Utilizing exchange rate, real interest rate, and foreign reserves indicators, I  seek to optimize policies that maintain a stable exchange rate while considering the impact of real interest rates on capital flows

# PROJECT TITLE 
Exchange Rate Stability Optimization

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
100 words to explain what your project is about to a general audience. 

In this project, I focused on maintaining a stable exchange rate for Nigeria by analyzing key economic indicators: exchange rate, real interest rate, and foreign reserves. By understanding how these indicators interact, I aim to develop strategies that optimize policies for stable exchange rates while considering the influence of real interest rates on capital flows.

## DATA
A summary of the data you’re using, remembering to include where you got it and any relevant citations. 

I gathered my dataset from the World Bank's official website. The dataset covers a range of economic indicators, spanning the period from 2000 to 2021, providing a comprehensive view of Nigeria's economic landscape over time.

## MODEL 
A summary of the model you’re using and why you chose it. 

My approach involves utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, particularly XGBoost. This ensemble learning algorithm excels at predictive tasks like that of my project, making it an ideal choice to analyze the complex relationships between economic indicators and exchange rate stability.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
Description of which hyperparameters you have and how you chose to optimise them. 

Fine-tuning my model requires optimizing hyperparameters. Employing different machine learning techniques I carefully adjusted the model's parameters to enhance its performance. This optimization process ensures that my model captures the intricate dynamics between the chosen indicators.

## RESULTS
A summary of your results and what you can learn from your model 

Evaluation of my model's performance is grounded in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. A validation RMSE of 0.0314 signifies the average discrepancy between predicted and actual values within the validation dataset. Moreover, a test RMSE of 0.0010 showcases the model's adeptness at forecasting on previously unseen data. These results suggest that my selected economic indicators offer valuable insights into exchange rate stability and its interactions with real interest rates and foreign reserves.
